          "text": "Postinternet art refers to a “splintered and loosely defined” tendency that entered mainstream art-world discourse in the early 2010s. Often cited as the “last major ‘movement’ in contemporary art” before the field became increasingly atomized, it remains an “odd, elusive, and perhaps ‘embarrassing’ neologism.” As Brian Droitcour noted, “[m]ost people I know think ‘Post-Internet’ is embarrassing to say out loud.” Crucially, the term does not describe art on the internet but art made after the internet—art that assumes an environment in which the web has become an “inescapable, essential” and effectively “disappeared” condition of life. Postinternet work is therefore seen as reflecting the “cultural logic of the internet-enabled stage of late capitalism in the 2010s.”"

          "text": "Departing from the earlier tradition of net.art—which was created for and experienced through web browsers—Postinternet art arises from the experience of being online, even if it is not itself encountered in digital space. It is shaped by conditions such as “ubiquitous authorship, the development of attention as currency, the collapse of physical space in networked culture, and the infinite reproducibility and mutability of digital materials.” Yet this approach attracted significant critique. Opponents argued that Postinternet art’s political stance was vague, its criticality thin, and its methods complicit with the very capitalist logics it purported to expose—claiming the work didn’t address anything critically but instead merely capitalized on those structures. The resulting aesthetic is frequently characterized as “highly superficial, glossy, and seeped in indifference,” sometimes deploying “meme-like qualities to circulate through artistic and non-artistic networks.”."

          "text": "Amalia Ulman, born in 1989 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, spent her formative years in northern Spain, a place she describes as traditionally working-class and factory-driven where she felt disconnected because of a lack of cultural access and a community that shared similar creative impulses. Coming from an immigrant background, her parents' isolation was significant, especially her mother's longing for Argentina, an experience which Ulman characterizes as \"very painful\" before widespread technology facilitated communication. The internet became the essential tool that allowed her family to bridge themselves to desired communities, whether familiar or creative. Ulman was initially drawn to platforms like Fotolog—a popular social media site in Spain and Latin America—because they allowed her to meet others who shared similar interests, finding a community that was \"arts friendly”  and felt more aligned with her than the \"macho and homophobic\" scene she knew locally.She used money earned from making clothes to pay for travel and visit friends from Fotolog who lived in bigger cities, especially in Barcelona, which allowed her to learn from those who had gone to art or fashion school, giving her access to a world of knowledge and net art that she could otherwise not afford due to her limited resources. This lifelong experience dealing with class and regional differences is reflected in her transition to film, particularly in her first feature film, El Paneta (The Planet), a dark comedy about eviction, which marked a deliberate return to the context of Spain to explore European working-class aesthetics after years of feeling pressure to exoticize her Argentinian background."

While her digital engagement on platforms like Fotolog and Live Journal allowed her to connect with friends in bigger cities and develop an understanding of digital spaces, she recognized that her pursuit of net art would be better served elsewhere. Indeed, Ulman acknowledged that a potential major step would have been to come to America, but knew she couldn’t afford it at the time. Instead, she went to London, believing it was \"the next best thing\" and hoping \"there's something going on\" in digital art there."

          "text": "However, her experience studying at Central Saint Martins in London proved challenging and validated her sense of being culturally misplaced. She was surprised to find that people didn’t have emails and found the engagement with digital art was \"non-existent\". Ulman's net art work was often disqualified by instructors if it didn’t work on computers which lacked internet access, despite her protestation that pervasive internet access meant \"there's internet everywhere\". The academic environment and the burgeoning Postinternet scene she encountered there were dominated by a \"very macho\" and \"broy\" attitude, where \"theater performance or any like it was very looked down upon by everybody\". This cultural rigidity, which clashed with her desire to be \"taken seriously as a net artist\", became a significant source of frustration, fostering her \"internal misogyny\" until she deliberately chose to fight against those expectations. This critical distance from the London art scene eventually led her to undertake her highly calculated online performance, Excellences & Perfections (E&P), in Los Angeles, a city where she found she \"could hide\" and more easily create a new persona without \"regularly bump[ing] into people you know in the street\"."

Art in Circulation #3\", documented the final talk in a series focused on \"art in circulation\" and the effects of internet circulation on \"bodies and images and circulation\". Curated and moderated by Michael Connor, editor and curator of Rhizome, the panel was notable for hosting the \"first ever real public outing\" of Amalia Ulman’s four-month durational performance, Excellences & Perfections. Ulman's presentation detailed the project's intention to \"boycott\" her online persona to \"undermine the capitalist undertone of my online presence\", using a \"full immersion in a screen reality\" following a script. She explained how her performance mapped onto easily recognizable social media archetypes—the \"cute, pink, grunge, blonde L.A. tumblr girl,\" the \"sugar baby,\" and the \"post rehab hippie yoga yoga goop\" (or \"life goddess\")—to prove \"how easy it is to manipulate an audience through images\". Connor further announced that Rhizome and the New Museum, through their First Look program, would archive E&P as a \"captured version of Amalia's Instagram profile\", recognizing the performance as a work of art that needed conservation in an era when the web shifted from a \"page kind of Paradigm to an application Paradigm\". The discussion, which also featured presentations on \"the black woman Cyborg\" and \"image bodies\", explicitly addressed the complexity of Ulman’s work as both a critique of self-branding and an appropriation of the experience of women who participate in the \"regime of cosmetic surgery and the selfie\"."

          "text": "The conversation \"Cultural Matter: Susan Gibb in Conversation with Amalia Ulman\" (c. 2020) offered a deep dive into the intentional progression of Ulman's work, particularly discussing the relationship between her two major online performances, Excellences & Perfections (E&P) and Privilege. Ulman clarified that E&P was used to \"groom an audience\" with easily understandable aesthetics and a simple narrative structure, paving the path for an \"equally critical but maybe even more sinister project\" of Privilege. The second performance used Instagram again to finally allow Ulman \"more free in a way to do weird stuff\" aesthetically and creatively, adding in installations, souvenirs, and photographs. The conversation emphasized the crucial role of duration—Privilege's \"pregnancy was… a big marker\" of the nine-month timeframe—and revealed how audience feedback shaped the work, noting that the character of \"Bob the pigeon\" grew more prominent after people \"really liked him\". This discussion also provided context for Ulman’s wider practice, noting that before E&P, she had done a lot of work involving \"video essays\". She explained that her video essays (which were originally PowerPoint presentations) were an attempt to be \"in charge of my words through a script\" for artist talks, which later became artworks in themselves. Crucially, Ulman highlighted her \"democratic approach to the media\", explaining that her move to filmmaking (where she controls stage design, costume, and photography) was driven by wanting people who \"do not live in New York do not live in London\" to be able to \"watch it from their computer in a way\" and have the \"full experience\" of her installations."

The discussion opens with Ulman's relationship to Fotolog, a social media site that was both popular in Spain and Latin America, notable for its constraint of one image upload per day. Ulman admits she had a previous hate relationship with the app, feeling embarrassed about her time on the site, but now feels \"kind of proud of my time in Fotolog\". This early digital life fostered subcultures, who developed their own Fotolog, which Ulman regards as an \"amazing vignette of technological independence\". Transitioning to art school, she revealed she wanted to have a desire for acceptance which led her to purposefully remove her images, having even learned \"how to code\" (HTML) through Live Journal. However, the early Postinternet environment in college was \"very macho\" and \"broy\", which fostered \"internalized misogyny\", leading her to believe she had to act a certain way to be taken seriously. The performance Excellences & Perfections (E&P), which lasted about four months and followed a script of three phases, was a complex response to this, intending to show that \"a fake truth generated through images has more validity than a verbalized genuine truth\". This work, which earned her the (contested) crown of the \"first great Instagram artist\" by L magazine, highlighted the \"electronic economy of looking good\" where non-celebrities are subjected to the pressure to \"perform for the camera\". Ulman's current positioning includes moving away from E&P—which became \"too big\" and created expectations for her to \"keep on making versions\" of it—to directing her film Magic Farm, a fictionalized critique of Vice News that engages with middlebrow aesthetics that took \"many many years, until now where I see a lot of like young, cool girls doing things with this sort of aesthetic\"."

          "text": "Amalia Ulman’s current practice in filmmaking is a calculated evolution that addresses the core thematic and structural challenges posed by Postinternet Art, while simultaneously rejecting the movement's formal and cultural constraints. The shift, exemplified by her first feature film El Paneta, is largely rooted in a \"democratic approach to the media\", transforming geographically exclusive installations (which she views as \"stage design\") into accessible narratives that people \"can watch it from their computer in a way\" and have the \"full experience\", solving Postinternet art’s persistent problem of exhibiting digital work outside of major centers like New York or London. Critically, filmmaking allows Ulman to escape the systemic pressure of platform capitalism; her famous Instagram performance, Excellences & Perfections, became \"too big\" and created the \"expectation of me to keep on making versions\", mirroring the endless reproduction and continuous labor demanded by the internet's attention economy. By embracing linear narrative, Ulman can \"close the chapter and move on\", controlling her image and formally escaping the art environment that stifled her net art practice in college. Aesthetically, she uses film to return to the \"context of Spain\" and focus on European working-class aesthetics, deliberately engaging with things she finds \"sort of gross originally\" and using the concept of \"middlebrow\" aesthetics to ground her critiques of class, thereby shifting the Postinternet debate away from the often privileged, hyper-aspirational personas she initially satirized. This move provides narrative control over elements like \"costume photography, everything\", enabling her to continue her observations on self-branding and digital identity—a key Posinternet art theme—while operating outside the restrictive label she grew \"sick of being considered\""
